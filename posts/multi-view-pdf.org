While [[https://github.com/wose/ts100][playing with Rust on Î¼Cs]] I've always at least one date sheet or reference
manual open. These pdf files, especially the reference manuals, are huge (> 1k
pages) and consume a fair amount of RAM when opened in a viewer like [[https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince][evince]] or
[[https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/][zathura]]. I found myself struggling to navigate between different parts of the
manual with a pretty high frequency. Take a look at some transfer sequence
diagram, check the description of the control register, go back to the diagram,
...

What I needed was a way to view at least two different parts of the same pdf
file at the same time. Turns out no pdf viewer known to me was able to split the
view into multiple views on the same document. Opening the file two times works,
but eats the RAM.

Someone suggested to implement it as some kind of plugin for Atom. Nahhh never,
if I had that much RAM to waste I would just open the file several times ;-)
But wait, Atom is an editor, I use an editor, I use Emacs, I bet Emacs can do
this.

And indeed Emacs would open the pdf file using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Document-View.html][DocView]] mode and handle it like a
normal buffer, which means I can open many windows and just point them at
different parts of the buffer. Cool but not optimal since I had no way to
recolor the pdf and don't go blind reading these at night (or day, doesn't
really matter for me). There is an alternative mode to work with pdf files:
[[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]]. And it's quite awesome. Using its midnight mode and customizing some
colors I was back to where I left zathura.

    '(pdf-view-midnight-colors (quote ("#f2be0f" . "#1a1a1a"))))
#+END_SRC

There is even a spacemacs layer you can enable by adding =pdf-tools= to your
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=.

And there I am wondering why I left Emacs to view pdf files in the first place.
Stupid me.
