It has been almost two years since the last blog entry and the amount of useful
information was always questionable so I ditched the whole thing and started
from scratch. I'm now using [[https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page][org-page]] which boils down to:

- =M-x op/new-post=
- write the post as Org file
- =git commit -a -m "adds new post"=
- =M-x op/do-publication=

to create and publish a new post. We'll see if these are few enough steps for
the lazy me to keep actually posting some stuff.
